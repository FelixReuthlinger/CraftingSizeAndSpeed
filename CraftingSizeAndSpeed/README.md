# Crafting Size And Speed

This is a very simple mod that can configure some crafting stations of the type:

1. Beehive
2. Cooking Station
3. Fermenter
4. Smelter

The configurations that it can change are regarding the number of fuel and items it can hold and how fast it does
process them.

## Features

### Create default configs

You can use a console command `crafting_configurtor_write_defaults` that will write the values from all stations loaded
in game to 4 files. To make use of those files, just remove the ".Default" from the file name and adjust values to your
requirements.
